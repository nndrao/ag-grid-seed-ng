You can modify the keyboard navigation speed in ag-Grid by customizing the component's key handlers. Here's how to add a delay for the down arrow key:

```javascript
const gridOptions = {
  // Your other grid options
  
  navigateToNextCell: function(params) {
    const previousCell = params.previousCellPosition;
    const suggestedNextCell = params.nextCellPosition;
    
    // Only apply delay for down arrow key
    if (params.key === 'ArrowDown' || params.key === 'Down') {
      // Return null initially to prevent immediate navigation
      setTimeout(function() {
        // After 100ms delay, manually navigate to the next cell
        params.api.forceNavigateTo({
          rowIndex: suggestedNextCell.rowIndex,
          column: suggestedNextCell.column
        });
      }, 100);
      
      return null; // Prevents default navigation
    }
    
    // For other keys, use default behavior
    return suggestedNextCell;
  }
};
```

This solution intercepts the down arrow key navigation, delays it by 100ms using setTimeout, and then manually forces navigation to the target cell. This should help with any painting or rendering issues you're experiencing.

You can adjust the delay time (100ms) as needed to find the optimal balance between responsiveness and rendering performance.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​









# AngularCli

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
